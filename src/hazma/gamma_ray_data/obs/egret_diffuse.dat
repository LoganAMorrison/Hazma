# EGRET observations in the search region 20 < |b| < 60. See
# fig. 1 of arXiv:1309.4091.
# Columns are:
#   1. Lower bin edge (MeV)
#   2. Upper bin edge (MeV)
#   3. E^2 d^2Phi/dEdOmega (MeV cm^-2 s^-1 sr^-1)
#   4. Upper error bar (MeV cm^-2 s^-1 sr^-1)
#   5. Lower error bar (MeV cm^-2 s^-1 sr^-1)
# Note that the error bar values are their y-coordinates, not their relative
# distances from the central flux.
